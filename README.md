#### By **Fred Papa**
## Description
This Portfolio Landing Page is designed to help individual and any hiring organizaton to have a view and access to the projects that I have already done since the start of my coding journey. The portfolio also reveals the technologies I used while designing the project to achieve the structure, the styling aspect and the general functionality. In the project, there are github links provided in order to access and view the page for live demonstration and for accesing my code, especially by the incoming developers who would  like to learn more from it. Some of the projects that I have already  done are "My photography website" and "food Street Website". Alot is coming while am still in this journey.
